    <div class="ml-5 font-mono relative bottom-6 text-base">Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in <br>1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company. <br> Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,<br> phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of <br>America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was <br>a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied <br>imagination to technology and business.</div>
